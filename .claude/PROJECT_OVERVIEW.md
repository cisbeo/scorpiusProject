# Scorpius Project - AI-Powered Public Procurement Bid Management Platform

## Executive Summary

Scorpius is an intelligent SaaS platform that revolutionizes how companies respond to French public procurement tenders (appels d'offres). By leveraging advanced AI technologies including RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), NLP, and intelligent document processing, Scorpius automates up to 80% of the bid preparation process, reducing response time from weeks to days while improving quality and compliance.

## Project Description

### The Challenge

French public procurement represents a €100+ billion market annually, yet SMEs and mid-market companies struggle to compete effectively due to:

- **Complexity**: Public tenders typically contain 100-500 pages across multiple documents (CCTP, CCAP, RC, DPGF, BPU, etc.)
- **Time Constraints**: Average tender response requires 80-120 hours of preparation
- **Error-Prone Process**: Manual analysis leads to missed requirements and non-compliance
- **Resource Intensity**: Requires dedicated bid managers with specialized expertise
- **Low Success Rate**: Average win rate is only 15-20% due to poor requirement matching

### The Solution

Scorpius provides an end-to-end AI-powered platform that:

1. **Ingests and analyzes** all tender documents automatically (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
2. **Extracts and maps** 100% of requirements with full traceability
3. **Generates intelligent responses** based on company capabilities and past successes
4. **Auto-fills pricing templates** (BPU, DPGF, DQE) with validation
5. **Orchestrates the complete workflow** from analysis to submission-ready package
6. **Provides GO/NO-GO recommendations** with 74%+ confidence scoring
