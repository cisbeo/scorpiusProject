# Feature Specification: MVP Bid Manager Intelligent Copilot Backend

**Feature Branch**: `001-construire-le-mvp`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "construire le MVP d'un back-end d'une application qui est le copilote intelligent pour un bid manager d'une ESN francais pour répondre aux appels d'offres publiques francaises, qui couvre tout le cycle : lecture, compréhension, adaptation, génération, conformité, stratégie"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A bid manager at a French IT services company needs to quickly respond to public procurement opportunities. They upload PDF procurement documents to the MVP system, which extracts key requirements and deadlines, analyzes them against a simplified company profile, generates a basic bid response following French administrative standards, performs essential compliance checks, and provides simple strategic recommendations. The MVP focuses on single-document processing with essential features only.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a single procurement PDF document, **When** the bid manager uploads it, **Then** the system extracts requirements, deadlines, and evaluation criteria within 30 seconds
2. **Given** extracted requirements, **When** the system analyzes company capabilities, **Then** it produces a basic matching score and identifies major gaps
3. **Given** a bid needs to be prepared, **When** the system generates initial content, **Then** it creates a draft response covering mandatory sections in French
4. **Given** a generated response, **When** compliance check runs, **Then** it flags critical missing elements and regulatory violations
5. **Given** procurement analysis is complete, **When** the user requests recommendations, **Then** the system provides basic go/no-go guidance with key risks

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the uploaded document is not a valid procurement document?
- How does the system handle corrupted or password-protected PDFs?
- What occurs when processing fails mid-way through the pipeline?
